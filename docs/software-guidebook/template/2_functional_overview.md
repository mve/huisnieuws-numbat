# Functional Overview

<!--
Intent

This section allows you to summarise what the key functions of the system are. It also allows you to make an explicit link between the functional aspects of the system (use cases, user stories, etc) and, if they are significant to the architecture, to explain why. A functional overview should answer the following types of questions:

• Is it clear what the system actually does?
• Is it clear which features, functions, use cases, user stories, etc are significant to the architecture and why?
• Is it clear who the important users are (roles,actors,personas,etc)and how  the system caters for their needs?
• It is clear that the above has been used to shape and define the architecture?

Alternatively, if your software automates a business process or workflow, a functional view should answer questions like the following:

• Is it clear what the system does from a process perspective?
• What are the major processes and flows of information through the system?
