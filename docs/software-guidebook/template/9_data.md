# Data

<!--
Intent

The purpose of the data section is to record anything that is important from a data perspective, answering the following types of questions:

• What does the data model look like?
• Where is data stored?
• Who owns the data?
• How much storage space is needed for the data? (e.g. especially if you’re dealing with “big data”)
• What are the archiving and back-up strategies?
• Are there any regulatory requirements for the long term archival of business data?
• Likewise for log files and audit trails?
• Are flat files being used for storage? If so, what format is being used?
