# Operation and Support

<!--
Intent

Most systems will be subject to support and operational requirements, particularly around how they are monitored, managed and administered. Including a dedicated section in the software guidebook lets you be explicit about how your software will or does support those requirements. This section should address the following types of questions:

• Is it clear how the software provides the ability for operation/support teams to monitor and manage the system?
• How is this achieved across all tiers of the architecture?
• How can operational staff diagnose problems?
• Where are errors and information logged? (e.g. log files, Windows Event Log, SMNP, JMX, WMI, custom diagnostics, etc)
• Do configuration changes require a restart?
• Arethereanymanualhousekeepingtasksthatneedtobeperformedonaregularbasis?
• Does old data need to be periodically archived?
