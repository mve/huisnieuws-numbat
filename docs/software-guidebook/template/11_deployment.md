# Deployment

<!--
Intent

This section is used to describe the mapping between the software (e.g. containers) and the infrastructure. Sometimes this will be a simple one-to-one mapping (e.g. deploy a web application to a single web server) and at other times it will be more complex (e.g. deploy a web application across a number of servers in a server farm). This section answers the following types of questions:

• How and where is the software installed and configured?
• Is it clear how the software will be deployed across the infrastructure elements described in the infrastructure architecture section? (e.g. one-to-one mapping, multiple containers per server, etc)
• If this is still to be decided, what are the options and have they been documented?
• Is it understood how memory and CPU will be partitioned between the processes running on a single piece of infrastructure?
• Are any containers and/or components running in an active-active, active-passive, hot-standby, cold-standby, etc formation?
• Has the deployment and rollback strategy been defined?
• What happens in the event of a software or infrastructure failure?
• Is it clear how data is replicated across sites?
