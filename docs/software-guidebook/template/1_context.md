# Context

<!--
Intent

A context section should answer the following types of questions:

• What is this software project/product/system all about?
• What is it that’s being built?
• How does it fit into the existing environment? (e.g. systems, business processes, etc) • Who is using it? (users, roles, actors, personas, etc)
-->
