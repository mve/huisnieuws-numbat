# Software Architecture

<!--
Intent

The purpose of this section is to summarise the software architecture of your software system so that the following questions can be answered:

• What does the “big picture” look like?
• Is there are clear structure?
• Is it clear how the system works from the “30,000 foot view”?
• Does it show the major containers and technology choices?
• Does it show the major components and their interactions?
• What are the key internal interfaces? (e.g. a web service between your web and business tiers)
